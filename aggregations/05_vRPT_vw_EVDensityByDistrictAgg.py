# MAGIC ####  5. EV Density by Legislative District (w/ Redistricting)
# MAGIC üí°Business Question
# MAGIC ‚ÄúWhich legislative districts had highest EV concentration ‚Äî before and after redistricting?‚Äù
# MAGIC üó∫Ô∏è Use with slicers for ‚ÄúPre-2020 Redistricting‚Äù vs ‚ÄúPost-2020‚Äù to compare policy impacts.
# MAGIC ‚ÄúWhich legislative districts had the highest EV concentration ‚Äî and how has that changed across different district versions (using EffectiveStartDate/EndDate as proxies for redistricting)?‚Äù
# MAGIC This view still supports time-based analysis even without DistrictVersion, because you can slice by date of registration vs. district‚Äôs effective dates.
