# ⚡ EVLytics: WA EV Population Lakehouse Project

This repository contains the full implementation of a modern **Electric Vehicle Registration Lakehouse**, designed and built using **Databricks**, **Delta Lake**, and **Kimball Dimensional Modeling** principles.

> 📍 Project Title: `EVLytics`  
> 🧱 Architecture: Medallion (Bronze → Silver → Gold)  
> 📊 Modelling: Dimensional (Star Schema)  
> ☁️ Platform: Databricks (Lakehouse, Delta Live Tables, Notebooks)

## 📐 Features

- ✅ **Incremental ingestion** with source tracking and schema evolution
- ✅ **Metadata enrichment** (SnapshotDate, IngestionDate, SourceSystem)
- ✅ **Comprehensive QA Checks** (Nulls, Referentials, Duplicates, Valid Ranges)
- ✅ **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)** implementation where applicable
- ✅ **Star Schema modeling** optimized for BI tools
- ✅ **Semantic Views** for insights like EV adoption trends, market share, and utility coverage

## 🔎 Data Overview

- **Source**: Washington State Department of Licensing (WA DOL)  
- **Granularity**: Snapshot-level EV registrations  
- **Snapshot Frequency**: Monthly  
- **Primary Entities**:
  - Vehicle Details (Make, Model, Electric Range, MSRP, etc.)
  - Geographic Info (City, County, Zip, Census Tract)
  - Electric Utilities
  - Legislative Districts (for policy impact analysis)

## 🌟 Semantic Views for Reporting

The following Gold views were created for Power BI / Semantic Layer:

1. **EV Adoption Trends**
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW View_EV_Registrations_OverTime
   ```
   > Track the monthly adoption of EVs, sliced by fuel type, state, and region.

2. **EV Market Share by Make/Model**
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW View_MarketShare_ByMakeModel
   ```
   > Understand top-performing manufacturers and vehicle types.

3. **EV Coverage by Utility**
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW View_EV_Coverage_ByUtility
   ```
   > Evaluate EV distribution by utility service areas.

4. **EV Range and MSRP Analysis**
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW View_EV_Range_MSRP_ByType
   ```
   > Compare electric range and price by EV type (BEV, PHEV, etc.)

5. **EV Density by District**
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW View_EV_Density_ByDistrict
   ```
   > Map EV concentration across legislative districts with historical boundary versions.

## 🧠 Insights

This project helps answer questions like:

- “Which electric utility areas have the most EVs?”
- “How is EV adoption evolving?”
- “What are the most common EV models and types registered?”
- “How do redistricting changes affect EV representation?”
- “What is the average electric range by EV type or county?”

---

## 🧰 Tools & Tech

- **Platform**: Databricks (SQL, Delta Lake, Notebooks)  
- **Language**: PySpark, SQL  
- **Architecture**: Medallion + Dimensional Modeling (Kimball)  
- **Storage Format**: Delta  
- **Reporting**: Power BI (Semantic Views)
